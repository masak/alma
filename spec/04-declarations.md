# Chapter 4: Declarations

Declarations establish a binding between a name and a value, or sometimes
several such name/value bindings. Unlike expressions whose primary role is to
be evaluated, and statements which are primarily executed, declarations add
their binding to the lexical environment.

```
<declaration> ::= <variable-declaration>
               |  <function-declaration>
               |  <macro-declaration>
               |  <class-declaration>
               |  <interface-declaration>
               |  <enum-declaration>
```
