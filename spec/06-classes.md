# Chapter 6: Classes

A _class_ is a form of type, common in object-oriented programming. Values
called _instances_ can be created from a (non-abstract) class; an instance `x`
created from class `X` satisfies the relation `x is X`.

Classes can also relate via subtyping. If a class `Y` is declared a subclass of
a class `X` (that is, `Y <: X`), then `y is Y` implies `y is X`.
